## Contributing 

> [!TIP]
> If you don't know how to do any of these steps with Git, please just ask on the discord server.

Use git to clone the repo. 

Once that is done, checkout the main branch. 

Create a new branch for your work. Do the work, and commit it to this branch. Make a PR to get the work back into the main branch. 

Let people know you have a PR ready for review on the discord server. 



## Initial goal 

The initial goal is to implement a prototype. The details of this can be found [here](./documentation/prototype_1.md).
